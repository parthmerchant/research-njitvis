As people run their technological devices all day year long, energy is being used at a rate higher than it has been in previous years. In order to reduce energy consumption, as citizens, we must understand in what sector weâ€™re consuming energy and how much we are using. Understanding energy usage on a micro and macro-level is essential to gaining insights on how we utilize energy and how we can potentially reduce our carbon footprint. Being able to understand how different states and countries consume energy is the goal of this project. Using existing visualization and user experience libraries and tools, we will be able to interactively and flexibly gain an understanding of how energy consumption has increased over the past century.
